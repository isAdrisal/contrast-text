# contrast-text
A small proof of concept script to determine the brightness of an image behind a text element, then use classes to set the text colour for appropriate contrast.

## Getting started
You'll need to run the `index.html` using a local server such as `http-server` to avoid security-related canvas errors.

## Works with
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge Legacy
- IE11
